This project primarily focuses on research related to 'Unlocking Phonon Transport in Twisted Bilayer Graphene with Machine-Learned Potentials: Insights from Phonon Hydrodynamics.' It includes input and output files associated with the machine-learned potential functions, as well as animation files of the structures in the training set. Below is a summary of the document's contents along with a brief introduction:


1.mp4	front view of training set animation display
2.mp4	side view of training set animation display
nep.in	NEP Input parameters
nep.txt  NEP potential parameters
train.xyz	training data for the construction 
energy_train.out  target and predicted energies for training data set
force_train.out  target and predicted forces for training data set
virial_train.out  target and predicted virials for training data set
